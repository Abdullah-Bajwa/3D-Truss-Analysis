# 3D-Truss-Analysis
It is a simple and lightweight program to handily analyse 3D trusses
The code iscompatible with both octave and matlab
Usage of the files hereby included is subject to MIT License


**Using the Program**
Both files must be opened simultaneously
The data in trussdata3d.m is to be edited according to the truss that needs to be analyzed
Detailed explanation for adding the truss data is mentioned inside the files
Once the data has been filled, the analysis can be conducted by calling the function 'truss3D()' and passing the file 'trussdata3d)' as the argument.
For illustration, following text is to be entered into the command window.
truss3D('trussdata3d')
